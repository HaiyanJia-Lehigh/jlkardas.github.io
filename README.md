## About
I am a rising senior at Lehigh University pursuing a degree in Computer Science & Business. I am interested in software development and have worked in the past as a freelance full stack developer creating websites for local small businesses.

I am taking this class because I want to know more about how data is translated and interpreted to create meaningful, compelling visual storylines. I am excited at the prospect of creating my own data stories and can't wait to see where it takes me.

## Lehigh Undergraduate Enrollment Spring 2020
### Pie Chart
This pie chart was created using Datawrapper as a course project of COMM 165, Data Storytelling. It shows the undergraduate enrollment in the different colleges and programs at Lehigh University for Spring 2020. The chart shows that Engineering & Applied Science has the largest enrollment, followed by College of Business & Economics. The data used to create the chart can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFnkn8Sm_aJHxFLC6DD8W4mIthVDjTIz6A0h-_kE2lA/edit#gid=0).

## Adults Without a Bank Account Owning a Mobile Phone
This pie chart represents the total number of adults, worldwide, who do not maintain a checking or savings account but do own a mobile phone. This data could be used to infer where the adoption of cryptocurrency would be most impactful. The data used to create the chart can be found [here](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/)

## Stablecoin Popularity by Region
The data represented in this map was sourced using a Python script from the official Twitter API. The map portrayed below specifically contains locations across the United States where tweets were created (from 7/17/20 to 7/22/20) containing the hashtag "stablecoin." As the map demonstrates, the majority of tweets came from New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. This anomoly in the data is to be expected, as the majority of stablecoins in development are located in these areas (ex. Silicon Valley). It would follow, that the communities discussing stablecoins would fall into the regions they are being developed in, especially as this technology is relatively new. As the adoption rate and popularity of stablecoins continues to grow not only in the United States but also in other countries around the world, this map is expected to show less concentrated hotspots and a more even distribution of tweets containing '#stablecoin'.
