## About
I am a rising senior at Lehigh University pursuing a degree in Computer Science & Business. I am interested in software development and have worked in the past as a freelance full stack developer creating websites for local small businesses.

I am taking this class because I want to know more about how data is translated and interpreted to create meaningful, compelling visual storylines. I am excited at the prospect of creating my own data stories and can't wait to see where it takes me.
